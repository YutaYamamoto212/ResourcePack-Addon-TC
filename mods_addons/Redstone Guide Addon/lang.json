  "rg.circuits.text1": "Circuits are designed to act in response to player activation or to operate autonomously either on a loop, or in response to non-player activity such as mob movement, item drops, plant growth, etc. The mechanisms controlled by redstone circuits range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches, to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. Understanding how to build and use redstone circuits and the mechanisms they can control greatly increases the range of what is possible in Minecraft.",
  "rg.circuits.text2": "The subject of redstone structures is very broad due to the large variety of redstone circuits that can be created; this guide provides only an overview of some of the different types of redstone circuits that can be built.",
  "rg.circuits.text3": "Although the number of ways to construct circuits is endless, certain patterns of construction occur over and over again. The following categories and sections attempt to categorize the circuits that have been useful to the Minecraft community, while this guide describe the specific circuits that fall into those categories.",
  "rg.circuits.text4": "Some example of circuits in this guide might be used by themselves for simple control of mechanisms, but frequently the player will need to combine them into more complex circuits to meet the needs of a mechanism.",
  "rg.transmissionCircuit.text0": "Â§eTransmission Circuit",
  "rg.transmissionCircuit.text1": "A transmission circuit is a redstone circuit which allows redstone signals to move from one place to another.",

  "rg.logicCircuit.text0": "Â§eLogic Circuit",
  "rg.logicCircuit.text1": "It's sometimes necessary to check signals against each other and only output a signal when the inputs meet some criteria. A circuit that performs this function is known as a logic gate (a \"gate\" that only allows signals through if the \"logic\" is satisfied).",
  "rg.logicCircuit.text2": "There are many different kinds of logic gates, each of which can be implemented with many different designs. Each design has various advantages and disadvantages, such as size, complexity, speed, maintenance overhead, or cost. The various sections will give many different designs for each gate type",
  "rg.clockCircuit.text0": "Â§eClock Circuit",
  "rg.clockCircuit.text1": "Clock Circuit is a circuit that send an endless signal at specific intervals. It produces a clock signal: a pattern of pulses which repeats itself. The time between the signals can be set by the player, either roughly or very accurately.",
  "rg.clockCircuit.text2": "Clock circuit is a pulse generator that produces a loop of specific pulses repeatedly. Some are designed to run forever, while others can be stopped and started.",
  "rg.memoryCircuit.text0": "Â§eMemory Circuit",
  "rg.memoryCircuit.text1": "Latches and flip-flops are effectively 1-bit memory cells. They allow circuits to store data and deliver it at a later time, rather than acting only on the inputs at the time they are given. As a result of this, they can turn an impulse into a constant signal, Â§6turning a button into a leverÂ§r.",
  "rg.memoryCircuit.text2": "Devices using latches can be built to give different outputs each time a circuit is activated, even if the same inputs are used, and so circuits using them are referred to as Â§6sequential logicÂ§r. They allow for the design of counters, long-term clocks, and complex memory systems, which cannot be created with combinatorial logic gates alone. Latches are also used when a device needs to behave differently depending on previous inputs.",
  "rg.memoryCircuit.text3": "There are several basic categories of latches, distinguished by how they are controlled. For all types, the input lines are labeled according to their purpose (Set, Reset, Toggle, Data, Clock). There are also more arbitrary labels: The output is commonly labeled Â§eQÂ§r for historical reasons. Sometimes there is also an Â§cinverse outputÂ§r labeled as Â§eQiÂ§r, which is always ON when Â§eQÂ§r is OFF and vice versa. If both Â§eQÂ§r and Â§eQiÂ§r are available, we say the circuit has Â§bdual outputsÂ§r. Most of the following types can be built as a Â§6latchÂ§r that responds to the level of a signal, or as a Â§6flip-flopÂ§r triggered by a change in the signal.",
  "rg.memoryCircuit.text4": "Â§oNOTE: Actually Â§cinverse outputÂ§oÂ§f labled as diacritic macron Q, it is a diacritic character which has line above the letter, we can't use it because Minecraft don't support those kind of characters so let use Â§eQiÂ§o as labeled insteadÂ§r",

  "rg.properties.text1": "Another method used for describing circuit size in the Minecraft community is to ignore non-redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between flat and 1-high circuits, as well as some other circuit differences. But in this guide it describe the size which includes support blocks.",
  "rg.properties.text2": "Sometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3x4 for a circuit three block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).",
  "rg.properties.text3": "A structure is 1-high (aka \"1-tall\") if its vertical dimension is one block high (meaning it cannot have any redstone components that require support blocks below them, such as redstone dust or repeaters). Also see flat.",

  "rg.properties.text5": "A structure is flat if it generally can be laid out on the ground with no components above another (support blocks under redstone components are okay). Flat structures are often easier for beginners to understand and build, and fit nicely under floors or on top of roofs. Also see 1-high.",
  "rg.properties.text6": "A structure is flush if it doesn't extend beyond a flat wall, floor, or ceiling and can still provide utility to the other side, though redstone mechanisms may be visible in the wall.

  "rg.properties.text12": "A structure is tileable if it can be placed directly next to other copies of itself, and each copy can still be controlled independently. Also see stackable.",
  "rg.properties.text13": "Structures might be described as \"2-wide tileable\" (tileable every two spaces in one dimension), or \"2x4 tileable\" (tileable in two directions), etc. Some structures might be described as Â§6alternating tileableÂ§r, meaning they can be placed next to each other if every other one is flipped or a slightly different design.",
  "rg.properties.text14": "Other design goals may include reducing the delay a sub-circuit adds to a larger circuit, reducing the use of resource-expensive components (redstone, nether quartz, etc.), and re-arranging or redesigning a circuit to make it as small as possible.",

  "rg.redstone.text2": "Mechanisms are complex systems of blocks used to perform certain tasks, such as opening a door from afar or revealing a hidden staircase. These systems are built from simple components and normally involve some kind of user input, such as breaking a torch, which generates some kind of result, like a door being revealed.

  "rg.analog.text0": "An analog encoding (aka \"hex wire\") is a transmission which outputs the same signal strength it receives as input. Because power levels can vary from 0 to 15, an analog transmission can convey 16 states in a single wire.",
  "rg.analog.text1": "Best option for short distances and tricky turns",
  "rg.analog.text2": "The simplest analog wire is a line of redstone comparators. However, like repeaters, comparators can draw a signal from an opaque block and push a signal into an opaque block, thus it is usually more efficient (in resources, and in signal delay) to place comparators every four blocks.",
  "rg.analog.text3": "The signal strength of an analog comparator wire (ACW) can be reduced or suppressed at some point along its length by feeding another signal into one of the comparators in subtraction mode. The signal can be overridden by feeding a stronger signal into one of the opaque blocks.",
  "rg.analog.text4": "Because the redstone dust is not adjacent to any power or transmission components, only opaque blocks, it will not configure itself to point in any particular direction. This will cause the dust to also power any opaque blocks or mechanism components to the side of the analog wire. Transmission components (redstone dust, redstone comparators, etc.) should not be placed adjacent to the wire's dust because that would cause the dust to configure itself in a way where it doesn't power the rest of the analog wire.",

  "rg.analog.text6": "Signal strength can also be retained by using repeaters to repeat every possible signal strength at the correct distance from the output to convey the correct signal strength.",
  "rg.analog.text7": "A single segment of analog repeater wire (ARW) consists of exactly 15 repeaters connecting an input line to an output line. To connect multiple segments together without additional comparators, the segments must be arranged so that the output dust of the last repeater is the same as the input dust of the next segment (i.e., block B of the previous segment is block A of the next segment). This causes the segments to overlap in distance by one block and causes each segment to be offset to the side from the previous segment by two blocks.",
  "rg.analog.text8": "Â§bVariationsÂ§r: To keep the segments in-line, or to turn against the direction the repeaters are facing, raise the final repeater by one block and drop the next segment underneath it.",
  "rg.analog.text9": "Another option is to use a comparator and an opaque block between the segments, and alternate the direction the repeaters are facing. This keeps the height to 2 blocks but increases the circuit delay to 2 ticks per 17 block.",
  "rg.analog.text10": "Complicated, infrequently useful",
  "rg.analog.text11": "If fewer than 15 states need to be transmitted, it may be more efficient to encode those N states in the higher levels of signal strength, and then repeatedly subtract the transmitted value from 15 after (17-N) dust, an even number of times.",
  "rg.analog.text12": "Â§bVariationsÂ§r: The chests can be replaced with any other full container. The chests can also be replaced with regular power components (redstone torches, powered levers, etc.) if the redstone dust next to them is raised or lowered by one block, or if the subtraction comparator and its power source are moved so that the redstone dust runs straight into the comparator's side with the comparator perpendicular to the line still facing into the same block.",
