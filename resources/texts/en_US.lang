pack.name=Better Bedrock Chinese Experience v1.4.6
pack.description=This resource pack aims to provide a better experience for Chinese players. Not only does it change all the wording from the vanilla version to be the same as the Java Edition and Minecraft Wiki, but it also corrects a lot of incorrect or even ridiculous translations. In addition, translations for some mods, add-ons, maps, and UI packs are also provided, and two languages ​​have been added—Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong SAR) and experimental Classical Chinese (Hua Xia).
